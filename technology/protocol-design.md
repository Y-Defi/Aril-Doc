# Protocol Design

### **1. Introduction​​**

Aril is a decentralized lending protocol engineered to unlock capital efficiency for DeFi users. It allows liquidity providers to leverage their LP token positions as collateral for loans while offering lenders a secure, yield-generating pool. This document details the robust, modular architecture that powers the protocol, ensuring security, efficiency, and transparency at every step. The system's design, as illustrated in the architecture diagram, is built around a core of smart contract modules that interact seamlessly to manage the entire lending lifecycle.

### **​​2. Architectural Overview​​**

The Aril protocol is structured into three distinct layers that facilitate a secure and efficient user experience:

1. ​**​Core Protocol Modules:​**​ The smart contract foundation handling all primary logic.
2. ​**​Support and Interface Modules:​**​ Tools for data querying and protocol management.
3. ​**​External Data and Liquidity Sources:​**​ The decentralized infrastructure that the protocol integrates with.

The following diagram illustrates the interaction between these core components, detailing the flow of data and assets that power the Aril lending ecosystem:

### **3. Core Protocol Modules​​**

This suite of interconnected smart contracts constitutes the immutable logic of the Aril protocol.​**​**

**3.1. Protocol Initialization System​**​

This is the foundational module that securely bootstraps and configures the protocol. It sets and manages all critical parameters, including supported LP token types, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, interest rate models, and liquidation penalties. This system ensures a secure and standardized starting point for all operations.​**​**

**3.2. LP Token Management Module​**​

The user journey begins here. This module is responsible for the secure custody and validation of LP tokens deposited from integrated ​**​AMM Protocols​**​ (e.g., Raydium, Orca). It handles the deposit, transfer, and release of collateral, ensuring tokens are held securely until the loan is repaid.​**​**

**3.3. Valuation and Risk Management Engine​**​

This is the computational heart of the protocol's security. It consumes price feeds from decentralized ​**​Oracle Data Sources​**​ (e.g., Chainlink) to perform two critical functions in real-time:

* ​**​Collateral Valuation:​**​ Calculating the fair market value of the deposited LP tokens.
* ​**​Health Factor Calculation:​**​ Determining a user's risk level by comparing the value of their collateral to their borrowed amount. The Health Factor is the single most important metric for determining borrowing capacity and liquidation risk.

​**​3.4. Lending Core System​**​

This module manages the core logic of borrowing and lending. It allows users to draw loans against their collateral, up to a limit defined by their Health Factor. All borrowing activity is facilitated by the ​**​USDC Pool​**​, from which assets are drawn. The system also manages the accrual and distribution of interest, ensuring lenders earn yield on their deposits.​**​**

**3.5. Liquidation System​**​

To protect the protocol from under-collateralized positions, this automated system is triggered when a user's Health Factor falls below a safe threshold. It allows liquidators to repay a portion of the outstanding debt in exchange for the user's collateral at a discounted price, thereby restoring the health of the protocol and protecting the USDC Pool.

### **​​4. Support and Interface Modules​​**

These components provide the necessary interfaces for users and administrators to interact with the core protocol securely and efficiently.​**​**

**4.1. Query System​**​

This off-chain indexing layer is crucial for user experience. It provides a fast, queryable interface to the blockchain, powering the frontend application with lightning-fast data on positions, market status, and historical activity. It abstracts away the latency of direct blockchain queries.​**​**

**4.2. Admin Tools​**​

A set of secure, permissioned functions that allow the protocol administrators to perform essential maintenance tasks. This includes listing new collateral types (subject to governance) and adjusting non-critical parameters, ensuring the protocol can adapt and upgrade in a secure manner.

### **​​5. System Workflow​​**

1. ​**​Initialization:​**​ The protocol is configured via the ​**​Protocol Initialization System​**​.
2. ​**​Deposit:​**​ A user deposits LP tokens via the ​**​LP Token Management​**​ module.
3. ​**​Valuation:​**​ The ​**​Valuation and Risk Management​**​ engine calculates the collateral value and initial Health Factor using oracle data.
4. ​**​Borrowing:​**​ Based on the Health Factor, the user can borrow USDC from the ​**​Lending Core System​**​, which draws from the ​**​USDC Pool​**​.
5. ​**​Monitoring & Liquidation:​**​ The Health Factor is continuously monitored. If it drops below the threshold, the ​**​Liquidation System​**​ is activated to protect the system's solvency.
6. ​**​Data Access:​**​ Throughout this process, the ​**​Query System​**​ provides real-time data to the user interface, while ​**​Admin Tools​**​ enable secure protocol management.

### **​​6. Conclusion​​**

The architecture of the Aril Lending Protocol is a testament to a meticulously designed DeFi primitive. By integrating specialized, interoperable modules for each critical function—from initialization and risk management to liquidation—the protocol achieves a powerful synergy. This design not only unlocks capital efficiency for users but also ensures the system remains robust, transparent, and secure under all market conditions.
