# ZK Proof Module

### **1. Introduction​​**

Aril is a decentralized lending protocol designed to maximize capital efficiency and security. While the core protocol enables lending against LP tokens, the ​**​Aril ZK Proof System​**​ establishes a new standard for transparency and trust in decentralized finance. This system utilizes Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to cryptographically verify the health and legitimacy of our off-chain operations—specifically yield-generation strategies on centralized exchanges (CEXs)—without exposing sensitive strategic or financial data.This document details the architecture and implementation of this groundbreaking transparency layer.

### **​​2. System Architecture & Integration​​**

The ZK Proof System acts as a secure verification layer that operates in parallel to the core lending protocol. It consumes data from both on-chain activities and off-chain exchange operations, generating verifiable proofs that are then anchored on-chain. This creates a trustless bridge between our off-chain strategies and on-chain user assurances.The following diagram illustrates how the ZK Proof System integrates with the broader Aril ecosystem, verifying the integrity of operations that support the USDC lending pool:

### **3. Core Proof Suite: Solving Critical Trust Problems​​**

The system is being developed as a suite of four interconnected ZK circuits, each designed to solve a specific trust problem.​**​**

**3.1. Proof of Account Control​**​

* ​**​Objective:​**​ To prove control of a valid, funded CEX account without revealing identifying information.
* ​**​MVP Implementation:​**​ The current circuit, built in ​**​Noir​**​, uses HMAC-SHA256 to verify a signature generated from valid API credentials. It proves a non-zero balance exists while keeping the account ID, API key, and exact balance private.
* ​**​Public Outputs:​**​ Timestamp, exchange ID, proof of validity.
* ​**​Private Inputs:​**​ API Key, Account ID, Balance.

​**​3.2. Proof of Fund Traceability​**​

* ​**​Objective:​**​ To create a verifiable link between assets in the CEX account and on-chain deposits in the Aril USDC Pool vault.
* ​**​Implementation:​**​ This circuit will use Merkle proofs to commit to deposit and withdrawal histories, allowing anyone to verify that the off-chain assets under management are backed by on-chain liabilities without revealing the entire transaction trail.

​**​3.3. Proof of Risk Neutrality​**​

* ​**​Objective:​**​ To demonstrate that the trading strategy maintains a market-neutral (Delta ≈ 0) position, minimizing speculative risk.
* ​**​Implementation:​**​ The circuit will integrate with decentralized oracles like the ​**​Pyth Network​**​ to fetch asset prices. It will then calculate the portfolio's delta based on the positions held, proving the net exposure is within a predefined, safe range.

​**​3.4. Proof of Actual Return Rate​**​

* ​**​Objective:​**​ To verify that the strategy achieves its promised benchmark returns.
* ​**​Implementation:​**​ Using time-weighted calculations verified inside the circuit, this proof will attest to the actual performance of the strategy over a specific period, providing a cryptographically secure performance report.

### **4. Conclusion​​**

The Aril ZK Proof System is a foundational advancement for transparency in DeFi. By leveraging zero-knowledge cryptography, we solve the critical problem of verifying off-chain activity in a trust-minimized way. This system not only protects our proprietary strategies but provides users with an unprecedented level of verifiable assurance about the security and performance of the assets backing their loans. This positions Aril not just as a lending protocol, but as a new standard for trust and transparency in decentralized finance.\
